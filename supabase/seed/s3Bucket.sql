        'Create a highly detailed 3D scene of an old, abandoned bungalow deep in a dense forest at night. The atmosphere is mysterious, with moonlight filtering through the towering trees, casting eerie shadows. In front of the bungalow, a group of 10 friends is raving to psychedelic music, their bodies moving in sync with the hypnotic beats. Glowing neon colors illuminate their surroundings as they dance in a trance-like state.

Above them, the sky has opened up into a swirling cosmic portal, radiating divine energy. Ethereal beams of light connect the friends to celestial beings—aliens and deities—who are communicating with them through vibrations. The air shimmers with magical energy, and mystical symbols glow in the sky. The entire forest pulses with an otherworldly aura, as if nature itself is resonating with the divine experience.

The scene should capture a surreal, dreamlike atmosphere with intricate textures, glowing elements, and an immersive sense of movement and energy.',

Above them, the sky has opened up into a swirling cosmic portal, radiating divine energy. Ethereal beams of light connect the friends to celestial beings—aliens and deities—who are communicating with them through vibrations. The air shimmers with magical energy, and mystical symbols glow in the sky. The entire forest pulses with an otherworldly aura, as if nature itself is resonating with the divine experience.

The scene should capture a surreal, dreamlike atmosphere with intricate textures, glowing elements, and an immersive sense of movement and energy.',

Here’s a detailed description of the bungalow based on your reference image:

Architecture: The bungalow has a long, single-story structure with a rustic and traditional design, featuring stone and plastered walls.
Color: The exterior walls combine exposed stonework with beige plaster, and some sections are painted white. The window and door frames are dark green.
Roof Type: It has a sloping, tiled roof with red clay tiles, giving it a countryside aesthetic. A chimney is present, adding to the vintage charm.
Windows: The windows are rectangular with green-painted wooden frames, and some have multiple glass panes.
Columns & Porch: The front porch extends along the length of the bungalow, supported by evenly spaced, purple-painted columns.
Surroundings: The house is nestled in a lush green environment, surrounded by trees and foliage. The ground has an earthy, reddish-brown dirt path leading to the entrance.

        'Create a highly detailed 3D scene of an old, abandoned bungalow deep in a dense forest at night. The atmosphere is mysterious, with moonlight filtering through the towering trees, casting eerie shadows. In front of the bungalow, a group of 10 male friends on lsd is raving to psychedelic music, their bodies moving in sync with the hypnotic beats. Glowing neon colors illuminate their surroundings as they dance in a trance-like state.

Above them, the sky has opened up into a swirling cosmic portal, radiating divine energy. Ethereal beams of light connect the friends to celestial beings—aliens and deities—who are communicating with them through vibrations. The air shimmers with magical energy, and mystical symbols glow in the sky. The entire forest pulses with an otherworldly aura, as if nature itself is resonating with the divine experience.

The scene should capture a surreal, dreamlike atmosphere with intricate textures, glowing elements, and an immersive sense of movement and energy.


Here’s a detailed description of the bungalow based on your reference image:

Architecture: The bungalow has a long, single-story structure with a rustic and traditional design, featuring stone and plastered walls.
Color: The exterior walls combine exposed stonework with beige plaster, and some sections are painted white. The window and door frames are dark green.
Roof Type: It has a sloping, tiled roof with red clay tiles, giving it a countryside aesthetic. A chimney is present, adding to the vintage charm.

Columns & Porch: The front porch extends along the length of the bungalow, supported by evenly spaced, purple-painted columns.

        'Create a highly detailed 3D scene of an old, abandoned bungalow deep in a dense forest at night. The atmosphere is mysterious, with moonlight filtering through the towering trees, casting eerie shadows. In front of the bungalow, a group of 10 male friends on lsd is raving to psychedelic music, their bodies moving in sync with the hypnotic beats. Glowing neon colors illuminate their surroundings as they dance in a trance-like state.

Above them, the sky has opened up into a swirling cosmic portal, radiating divine energy. Ethereal beams of light connect the friends to celestial beings—aliens and deities—who are communicating with them through vibrations. The air shimmers with magical energy, and mystical symbols glow in the sky. The entire forest pulses with an otherworldly aura, as if nature itself is resonating with the divine experience.

        'Create a highly detailed 3D scene of an old, abandoned bungalow deep in a dense forest at night. The atmosphere is mysterious, with moonlight filtering through the towering trees, casting eerie shadows. In front of the bungalow, a group of 10 male friends on LSD is raving to psychedelic music, their bodies moving in sync with the hypnotic beats. A DJ stands at the corner, mixing music , amplifying the surreal energy of the scene. Glowing neon colors illuminate their surroundings as they dance in a trance-like state.

Above them, the sky has opened up into a swirling cosmic portal, radiating divine energy. Ethereal beams of light connect the friends to celestial beings—aliens and deities—who are communicating with them through vibrations. The air shimmers with magical energy, and mystical symbols glow in the sky. The entire forest pulses with an otherworldly aura, as if nature itself is resonating with the divine experience.

The scene should capture a surreal, dreamlike atmosphere with geometrical patterns, intricate textures, glowing elements, and an immersive sense of movement and energy, dark secrets and patterns hidden in the universe—everything deeply connected with meaning.

        'Surreal Forest Rave – A 3D Scene
Create a highly detailed 3D scene of an old, abandoned bungalow deep in a dense forest at night. Moonlight filters through the towering trees, casting eerie shadows across the overgrown surroundings. The air is thick with mystery, as an otherworldly energy pulses through the landscape.

In front of the bungalow, 10 friends, lost in the depths of an LSD-fueled trance, rave to hypnotic psychedelic beats. Their bodies move in perfect sync, illuminated by shifting neon hues that ripple through the night. A DJ, stationed at the corner with a minimalist setup—just a laptop and a few essential controls—crafts the soundscape, intensifying the surreal experience.

Above them, the sky splits open into a swirling cosmic portal, radiating divine energy. Ethereal beams of light descend, linking the friends to celestial beings—aliens and deities—who communicate through pure vibration. Mystical symbols pulse in the sky, shifting in fractal patterns, revealing hidden truths of the universe. The entire forest breathes with a supernatural aura, as if the very fabric of reality is bending to the rhythm of the music.

The scene should evoke a dreamlike, transcendent atmosphere with intricate geometrical patterns, glowing textures, and a deep sense of cosmic connection—blurring the lines between reality, consciousness, and the unknown.

Porch: A weathered front porch extending along the house, supported by evenly spaced purple-painted columns.
Surroundings: Dense forest with towering trees, tangled vines, and glowing fungi. A reddish-brown dirt path leads up to the entrance, worn down by time.
This 3D scene should immerse the viewer in a fusion of psychedelic energy, cosmic wonder, and the eerie beauty of an abandoned forest hideaway.',

        'Surreal Forest Rave – A 3D Scene
Create a highly detailed 3D scene of an old, abandoned bungalow deep in a dense forest at night. Moonlight filters through the towering trees, casting eerie shadows across the overgrown surroundings. The air is thick with mystery, as an otherworldly energy pulses through the landscape.

In front of the bungalow, 10 friends, lost in the depths of an LSD-fueled trance, rave to hypnotic psychedelic beats. Their bodies move in perfect sync, illuminated by shifting neon hues that ripple through the night. A DJ, stationed at the corner with a minimalist setup—just a laptop and a few essential controls—crafts the soundscape, intensifying the surreal experience.

Above them, the sky splits open into a swirling cosmic portal, radiating divine energy. Ethereal beams of light descend, linking the friends to celestial beings—aliens and deities—who communicate through pure vibration. Mystical symbols pulse in the sky, shifting in fractal patterns, revealing hidden truths of the universe. The entire forest breathes with a supernatural aura, as if the very fabric of reality is bending to the rhythm of the music.

The scene should evoke a dreamlike, transcendent atmosphere with intricate geometrical patterns, glowing textures, and a deep sense of cosmic connection—blurring the lines between reality, consciousness, and the unknown.

Bungalow Details:
Architecture: A long, single-story rustic structure with stone and plastered walls.
Color: Exposed stonework with beige plaster, some sections painted white; dark green window and door frames.
Roof: Sloping red clay tile roof with a vintage chimney.
Windows: Rectangular green wooden frames, some with multiple glass panes.
Porch: A weathered front porch extending along the house, supported by evenly spaced purple-painted columns.
Surroundings: Dense forest with towering trees, tangled vines, and glowing fungi. A reddish-brown dirt path leads up to the entrance, worn down by time.

Ethereal beams of light descend, linking the friends to celestial beings—aliens and deities—who communicate through pure vibration. Mystical symbols pulse in the sky, shifting in fractal patterns, revealing hidden truths of the universe. The entire forest breathes with a supernatural aura, as if the very fabric of reality is bending to the rhythm of the music.

        'Create a highly detailed 3D scene of an old, abandoned bungalow deep in a dense forest at night. The atmosphere is mysterious, with moonlight filtering through the towering trees, casting eerie shadows. In front of the bungalow, a group of 10 male friends on LSD is raving to psychedelic music, their bodies moving in sync with the hypnotic beats.

At the heart of the experience, the DJ stands with a minimal yet powerful setup—a laptop and a cold beer. He is not just mixing music; he is the architect of the energy, the unseen force guiding the rave. Each beat he triggers sends waves of high-BPM frequencies and vibrations into the air, shaping the reality around them. His presence is magnetic, throwing connections everywhere, binding the dancers into one synchronized flow. The pulsating basslines resonate with the very fabric of the forest, making the ground and trees vibrate as if they, too, are alive with the rhythm.

Above them, the sky has opened up into a swirling cosmic portal, radiating divine energy. Ethereal beams of light connect the friends to celestial beings—aliens and deities—who are communicating with them through vibrations. The air shimmers with magical energy, and mystical symbols glow in the sky. The entire forest pulses with an otherworldly aura, as if nature itself is resonating with the divine experience.

        'Create a highly detailed 3D scene of an old, abandoned bungalow deep in a dense forest at night. The atmosphere is mysterious, with moonlight filtering through the towering trees, casting eerie shadows. The air vibrates with an unseen force, pulsing in harmony with the universe’s hidden patterns.

In front of the bungalow, a group of 10 male friends is raving to psychedelic music, their bodies moving in perfect sync with the hypnotic beats. The DJ man stands at the side of this surreal ritual, his presence commanding yet effortless. His setup is minimal—just a laptop and a beer—but his influence is vast. He is the unseen architect of the experience, orchestrating high-BPM frequencies that weave through the dancers like an invisible current. Each beat he drops sends ripples of connection through the space, linking bodies, minds, and dimensions. His very essence radiates an unspoken language of rhythm, a bridge between the physical and the ethereal.

Above them, the sky cracks open into a swirling cosmic portal, revealing the hidden mechanics of the universe. Ethereal beams of light descend, but not as artificial neon hues—instead, they are ancient symbols, sacred geometrical shapes, and pulsating fractal patterns, all shifting in harmony with the music. Celestial beings—aliens, deities, and interdimensional entities—observe in silence, transmitting knowledge through pure vibration. The entire forest pulses as if nature itself is alive, resonating with the divine frequencies that connect everything.

        'Create a highly detailed 3D scene of an old, abandoned bungalow deep in a dense forest at night. The setting is mysterious and otherworldly, with moonlight filtering through towering trees, casting eerie shadows across the overgrown surroundings. The forest feels alive, pulsing with an invisible energy that syncs with the rhythm of an unseen force.

In front of the bungalow, 10 male friends, completely lost in an LSD-fueled trance, rave to high-BPM psychedelic beats. Their movements are synchronized, not just with the music but with the vibrations of the universe itself. They are part of something bigger—an unspoken connection linking them to forces beyond comprehension. The air around them shimmers with an unseen resonance, shifting their very perception of reality.

At the center of this ritual stands the DJ—an enigmatic figure with a minimalist setup consisting of just a laptop and a beer. He is the conductor of this cosmic dance, crafting hypnotic soundscapes that send waves of energy rippling through the atmosphere. He isn’t just playing music—he is channeling vibrations, throwing connections everywhere, and amplifying the trance-like experience. His presence merges with the frequencies, making him both the source and the vessel of the energy that consumes the space.

Above them, the sky opens up into a swirling cosmic portal, revealing the hidden mechanisms of the universe. Ethereal beams of light descend, but not as artificial neon glows—these are ancient, sacred symbols, fractal geometries, and cryptic patterns woven into the very fabric of existence. The forest itself breathes, as if acknowledging the connection between these ravers and something greater. Celestial beings—aliens, deities, and interdimensional entities—observe from beyond, transmitting knowledge through pure vibration, revealing secrets that only those truly attuned can perceive.

Bungalow & Environment Details:
Architecture: A long, single-story rustic bungalow, worn by time yet standing strong.
Material & Color: Exposed stone walls, sections of aged beige plaster, and dark green wooden frames for the windows and doors.
Roof: A sloping red clay tile roof with a vintage chimney, partially covered in moss.
Windows: Rectangular green wooden frames, some with multiple glass panes, reflecting the energy of the scene.
Porch: A weathered wooden front porch, extending along the house, supported by purple-painted columns that seem to hum with unseen frequencies.
Surroundings: A dense ancient forest with towering trees, tangled vines, and patches of glowing bioluminescent fungi scattered along the reddish-brown dirt path leading to the entrance. Hidden throughout the environment are cryptic symbols and geometrical patterns, subtly woven into the textures of trees, rocks, and even the bungalow’s walls.
This scene should evoke a surreal, dreamlike journey—where reality, consciousness, and the unknown merge into one. The hidden universe lights and symbols should subtly emerge across different elements, reinforcing the idea that everything is deeply connected. The entire space should feel alive, pulsating with unseen forces, where music, movement, and the cosmos align in a breathtaking, immersive experience.',
